- Personalized smart indenting

- Folder search
- Code execution with error capture
- Templates
- Shortcuts configuration

## Historic

Since the old source code hosting (http://codigolivre.org.br) is now deactivated, I've ressurrected this project from my backup disk in order to keep it alive, at least for historical purposes. The real historic is available on the file [History.txt](History.txt).

## How to compile

The last update was around 2004, so finding a Delphi compiler from this year (Delphi 5-6) will be more suitable, besides this, it's only required to install the [bLink](3rdparty/components/bLink) component on the IDE.
